In the camera config_files (robot.conf Should we change this to camera.conf?) add the following lines:

camera #camera  (e.g. camera 1)
botId1 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId1 srv12)
botId2 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId2 srv14) // You don't need to specify this if you have only 1 robot.
botId3 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId3 BlackFin1) // You don't need to specify this if you have only 2 robots.

The name of the robot must match the name given in the Robot Controller. A common mistake (I do it a lot!) is to name the robot in the Robot Controller as srv12 and put in the camera svr12. If the name doesn't match the camera would not care about tracking that robot.
