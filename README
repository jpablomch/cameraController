In the camera config_files (robot.conf Should we change this to camera.conf?) add the following lines:

camera #camera  (e.g. camera 1)
botId1 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId1 srv12)
botId2 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId2 srv14)
botId3 nameOfRobotToTrack  (e.g. botId3 BlackFin1)

The name of the robot must match the name given in the Robot Controller. A common mistake (I do it a lot!) is to name the robot in the Robot Controller as srv12 and put in the camera svr12. If the names don't match the camera would not care about tracking that robot.
